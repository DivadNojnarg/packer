### About

Packer enforces good practice and provides convenience functions to make work with JavaScript not just easier but also scalable. Packer is a robust wrapper for [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) and [webpack](https://webpack.js.org/) that enables to modularise JavaScript code, leverage npm packages, and much more.

### Inspiration

This package is heavily inspired by [golem](http://golemverse.org/), [htmlwidgets](http://www.htmlwidgets.org/), and [usethis](https://usethis.r-lib.org/).
