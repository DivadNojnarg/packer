An opinionated framework for using JavaScript with R.

### About

Packer enforces good practice and provides convenience functions to make work with JavaScript not just easier but also scalable. Packer is a robust wrapper for [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) and [webpack](https://webpack.js.org/) that enables to modularise JavaScript code, leverage npm packages, and much more.

### Inspiration

The scaffolds are very much inspired by the same functionality from [htmlwidgets](http://www.htmlwidgets.org/) `scaffoldWidget` function and [golem](http://golemverse.org/) `create_golem`.

### Related Work

If you enjoy packer you should explore [reactR](https://github.com/react-R/reactR) which does something very similar to packer to create React-powered widgets and inputs.
