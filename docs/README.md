An opinionated and robust framework for using JavaScript with R.

### About

Packer enforces good practice and provides convenience functions making work with JavaScript not just easier but fun, interesting, and scalable. Packer is a solid wrapper for [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) and [webpack](https://webpack.js.org/) that enables structuring, modularizing and leveraging npm packages to use in R packages.

### Inspiration

This package is heavily inspired by [golem](http://golemverse.org/), [htmlwidgets](http://www.htmlwidgets.org/), and [usethis](https://usethis.r-lib.org/).
